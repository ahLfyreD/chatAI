# DOS.AI - Powered by CUDOS Intercloud

## Overview
DOS.AI is an intelligent chatbot application that provides instant responses to user queries related to blockchain protocols. The chatbot leverages AI-powered responses and ensures seamless communication between users and the system. This project is backed by **CUDOS Intercloud**, providing robust cloud computing resources to enhance performance and scalability.

## Features
- Real-time chatbot interactions
- AI-generated responses based on user input
- Secure API requests with HTTPS handling
- Optimized UI for seamless user experience

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **AI API:** AIML API
- **Hosting & Cloud Services:** CUDO Intercloud
- **Other:** Axios, CORS, HTTPS Agent

## How It Works
1. Users send messages through the chat interface.
2. The frontend communicates with the backend, which processes the request.
3. The backend calls the AIML API to generate responses.
4. The response is sent back and displayed in the chat UI.

## Deployment
This application is deployed on **CUDOS Intercloud** for optimal performance and reliability.

## Troubleshooting
- If CORS issues occur, ensure the backend allows requests from the frontend domain.
- For SSL certificate warnings, the HTTPS agent has been set to bypass strict verification.
- If responses are delayed, check API rate limits or network connectivity.
